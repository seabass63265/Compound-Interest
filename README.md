For this assignment, I created a responsive web app to compute compound interest using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features a form where users can input the principal, interest rate, number of times compounded per year, and total years, with real-time updates showing the amount earned and the total. I used grid and flexbox layouts, added a gradient, and imported a custom Google Font. I also made sure the site is mobile-friendly, and included transitions, transforms, margins, and padding.
